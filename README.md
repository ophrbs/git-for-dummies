git clone is basically a combination of:

- `$ git init` (create the local repository)
- `$ git remote add` (add the URL to that repository)
- `$ git fetch` (fetch all branches from that URL to your local repository)
- `$ git checkout` (create all the files of the main branch in your working tree)
</details>

<hr>

```
$ git status
```

show the working tree status (if there's a new file or a modified one, and if it's already added or not, etc)

<hr>

```
$ git add
```

prepare the file to be commited

<details>
<summary>see: adding multiple files</summary>

- `git add [file]` (add a particular file to index)
- `git add [directory]` (add an entire directory to index)
- `git add .` (indexes all the new and modified files, except for the files that have been removed)
- `git add ‚Äìu` (indexes all modified and removed files, except for the new files created)
- `git add ‚Äìall` (indexes all new, modified and removed files, it is a combination of both `git add .` & `git add -u`)
